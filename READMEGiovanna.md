The program I (ben) wrote takes in your ssn and adds 1 to it it also takes your name ad prints it all out
```python
name = input("what is your name:")
name = name.title()
num = int(input("what is your social security number (please dont include spaces)"))
num += 1
```
This code is shown taking in a name and then applyig the title method then it is shown taking in a number as an input then adding 1 this is how most of the code works
